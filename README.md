## Study Materials

Class might be over, but this is just the beginning of your prep!

### Approach

Treat your brain like a computer: there is only so much that fits in our working memory at a given time. When you solve a problem, see if there are other *ways* to solve it, and then come back to the question in 2-3 days. Cramming is less-effective than finding a schedule that lets you test your growth and memory.

### Additional Resources

Here are some practice resources that offer more information and paths than simply trying Leetcode. You won't need to master every question, but make sure you know your way around the big topics!
